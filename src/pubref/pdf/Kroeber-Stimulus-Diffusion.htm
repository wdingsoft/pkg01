	STIMULUS DIFFUSION</p>
<p>
	By A. L. KROEBER</p>
<p>
	<br />
	PROPOSE to discuss a particular form of the widely occurring process<br />
	of diffusion or spread of cultural material. Diffused culture material<br />
	often contains concrete or specific elements by which the fact of diffusion<br />
	can be subsequently recognized even in the absence of a record of the event.<br />
	In some cases it happens that the diffusion is definitely piecemeal; only<br />
	fragments of a larger complex or system reach the affected culture or are<br />
	accepted by it. In this event, the fragments or isolated items may be put<br />
	into an entirely new context in the culture which they enter. Such partial<br />
	bits may diffuse more widely than the patterns or systems or complexes of<br />
	which they form a part. In the inter-influencing of cultures, it must frequently<br />
	happen that a new item or specific trait fills some need or is of obvious<br />
	advantage in a culture which has not previously possessed it; or at any rate<br />
	that there is nothing already established with which it would have to compete<br />
	for acceptance. On the other hand a system or pattern, being a larger<br />
	thing, is more likely to encounter a corresponding system already in operation.<br />
	Even if much of a system is of such a nature that the receiving culture<br />
	might be hospitable or neutral toward it, there may be items within the<br />
	system which the receiving culture will resist with sufficient vigor to preclude<br />
	acceptance of the system as a whole.</p>
<p>
	<br />
	The type of diffusion which I am now about to examine is in some ways<br />
	of an opposite kind. <span style="background-color:#ffff00;">It occurs in situations where a system or pattern as</span><br />
	<span style="background-color:#ffff00;">such encounters no resistance to its spread, but there are difficulties in regard</span><br />
	<span style="background-color:#ffff00;">to the transmission of the concrete content of the system. In this case</span><br />
	<span style="background-color:#ffff00;">it is the idea of the complex or system which is accepted, but it remains for</span><br />
	<span style="background-color:#ffff00;">the receiving culture to develop a new content. This somewhat special process</span><br />
	<span style="background-color:#ffff00;">might therefore be called &quot;idea-diffusion&quot; or &quot;stimulus-diffusion.&quot;</span></p>
<p>
	Obviously this process is one which will ordinarily leave a minimum of<br />
	historical evidence. In a great many cases in history, as just pointed out,<br />
	evidence as to the process of diffusion is much more scant than of the effects.<br />
	In other words, much diffusion takes place below the surface of historical<br />
	record. The evidence for it is therefore indirect or inferred, although<br />
	the conclusions may be none the less indubitable. With idea-diffusion the<br />
	1<br />
	2 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 42, 1940<br />
	situation is different, because while systems or complexes in two or more<br />
	cultures may correspond in functional effect, the specific items of cultural<br />
	content, upon which historians ordinarily rely in proving connection, are<br />
	likely to be few or even wholly absent. Positive proofs of the operation of<br />
	idea-diffusion are therefore, in the nature of the case, difficult to secure long<br />
	after the act, or wherever the historical record is not quite full. Theoretically<br />
	they would be best observed in contemporary culture, were it not that<br />
	the culture historian necessarily lacks perspective in interpreting the contemporary;<br />
	he cannot discriminate, in the flux that surrounds him, which<br />
	features will develop and lead to further effects, and which will prove to<br />
	have been only transient fluctuations or abortive starts.<br />
	Fortunately, however, we possess a few cases that are at least near-contemporary<br />
	and supported by a fair degree of factual evidence.</p>
<p>
	<br />
	1. One of these instances concerns the invention of porcelain in Europe<br />
	in the early eighteenth century. Chinese porcelain had been coming to<br />
	Europe for nearly two hundred years and naturally excited admiration. A<br />
	definite goal was accordingly set: to produce porcelain without the heavy<br />
	expense of import from China. The problem was to find the necessary materials<br />
	at home and to develop the required technical skills. After a considerable<br />
	period of conscious experimentation the necessary kaolin deposits<br />
	were discovered, first in Germany and then elsewhere in Europe, and the<br />
	specific technologies needed were developed.1 The consequence is that we<br />
	have here what from one angle is nothing else than an invention. Superficially<br />
	it is a &quot;parallel,&quot; in the technical language of ethnology. However,<br />
	it is equally significant that the invention, although original so far as<br />
	Europeans were concerned, was not really independent. A goal or objective<br />
	was set by something previously existing in another culture; the originality<br />
	was limited to achieving the mechanisms by which this goal could be attained.<br />
	If it were not for the preexistence of Chinese porcelain, and the fact<br />
	of its having reached Europe, there is no reason to believe that Europeans<br />
	would have invented porcelain in the eighteenth century, and perhaps not<br />
	until much later, if at all.</p>
<p>
	<br />
	2. Another historic example is furnished by the invention of the socalled<br />
	alphabet, really a syllabary, for the Cherokee language by Sequoya,<br />
	or John Gist or Guest or Guess, about 1821.2 Although part white in blood,<br />
	1 First by B6ttger and Tschirnhaus in Dresden, 1708-09.<br />
	2 Grant Foreman, Sequoyah, (a biography), (University of Oklahoma Press, 1938). J. C.<br />
	Pilling, Guess, in Bibliography of the Iroquoian Languages (Bureau of American Ethnology,<br />
	Bulletin 6, 1888). Sequoya, in Handbook of American Indians (Bureau of American Ethnology,<br />
	Bulletin 30, Pt. 2, 1910).<br />
	KROEBER] STIMULUS DIFFUSION 3<br />
	he grew up without knowledge of English and without schooling. He did<br />
	become impressed with the advantages which writing gave to the whites<br />
	and resolved to provide the Indians with a corresponding instrument. The<br />
	result was his singlehanded creation of a new system of writing. In this he<br />
	discarded the alphabetic character of English writing and substituted a<br />
	syllabic one. It is not clear why he made the substitution. It is true that a<br />
	syllabary more easily represents the Cherokee language than a syllabary<br />
	would represent English, because Cherokee lacks the heavy consonant<br />
	accumulations so characteristic of English. However, the fact that<br />
	syllabic writing did readily represent Cherokee satisfactorily is in itself<br />
	no reason which enforced the choice of the syllabic system, for modern<br />
	linguists have no difficulty whatever in writing Cherokee with a suitable<br />
	alphabet. It is therefore possible that Sequoya&#39;s choice of a syllabic system,<br />
	which involved a change from his model, rests upon a pyschological fact,<br />
	namely that non-literate peoples have again and again been found able to<br />
	syllabify their words on request, that is to break them up without difficulty<br />
	into their constituent syllables, but are in general unable to break up the<br />
	syllables farther into the constituent elemental sounds or phonemes. They<br />
	can of course be taught to do the latter, but rarely if ever make the analysis<br />
	spontaneously.<br />
	Sequoya&#39;s choice also constitutes rather strong internal evidence that,<br />
	while he had picked up some facts about the system of English letters-he<br />
	is said to have had a spelling book in his house-his knowledge remained<br />
	so deficient that he had not grasped the alphabetic principle. If he had, he<br />
	would almost certainly have applied this principle with such minor modifications<br />
	as seemed to him desirable to make it fit the sounds of Cherokee.<br />
	At any rate the degree to which culture conditions the individual makes it<br />
	possible if not probable that this is what would have happened if Sequoya<br />
	had started with adequate control of English writing. He would in that<br />
	case have been no more than an adapter or applier-a sort of supplementary<br />
	inventor. That he altered the basic principle of writing stamps him as<br />
	a person of originality capable of a primary invention.<br />
	However, it is clear that if it had not been for the presence of writing in<br />
	the Caucasian civilization with which he was in contact, Sequoya would<br />
	certainly never have had the objective or goal of a system of writing arise<br />
	in his mind. In this sense his original invention was dependent upon culture<br />
	contact, and is an example of diffusion as well as of invention. It seems that<br />
	this case exemplifies very well the appropriateness of the terms stimulusdiffusion<br />
	and idea-diffusion.<br />
	Moreover, we have tangible evidence that diffusion was operative, in<br />
	4 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 42, 1940<br />
	the fact that Sequoya included among the symbols of his syllabary many<br />
	characters of the English alphabet. He did not draw upon the whole of the<br />
	alphabet, and those letters which he adopted are sometimes turned upside<br />
	down, or sometimes lower-case instead of capitals. Of course he needed<br />
	more characters to represent the syllables of his language than twenty-six.<br />
	His system contains eighty-six symbols. Some of these, besides those taken<br />
	over from English, appear to be modifications of English letters; others<br />
	are devised outright, without visible relation to English characters.&#39; In no<br />
	case does a character borrowed from English retain its English phonetic<br />
	value. Thus A is written for the sound cluster &quot;go,&quot; B for &quot;ya,&quot; C for<br />
	&quot;tli,&quot; D for &quot;a,&quot; and so on.<br />
	It is thus clear what happened. Sequoya took over from Caucasian civilization<br />
	not only the goal or objective of his invention but certain of its<br />
	specific items or content like the shapes of particular letters; but, operating<br />
	on a new principle, he &quot;misapplied&quot; these borrowed items, so that their<br />
	value or function in the new system was quite different-wholly arbitrary, or<br />
	we might say erroneous from the point of view of the system which induced<br />
	them.<br />
	For this reason if we had no information whatsoever about Sequoya and<br />
	his life history, but had subsequently discovered the Cherokee writing as a<br />
	system of whose history we knew nothing, it would be difficult to decide<br />
	whether or not the Cherokee system was a derivative from the English (or<br />
	Roman) one. Culture historians would almost inevitably seize upon the<br />
	identical symbols like A, B, C, as possible evidence of connection; but then<br />
	would be baffled by the fact that these symbols both have a non-corcordant<br />
	value in Cherokee, and form part of a system constructed on a fundamentally<br />
	different principle. The chances are that historians might therefore in<br />
	such a case harbor suspicions of influence, but, being unable to account for<br />
	much the larger part of the Cherokee system by transmission, would consider<br />
	the case for connection unprovable.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	3. It is an interesting fact that there is a fairly close parallel to Sequoya&#39;s<br />
	diffusion-invention in Africa, only a little later, before 1849, among the<br />
	Vei or Vai of the Liberian coast. Here, too, writing and its utility were ob-<br />
	3 18 characters are English capitals, 2 are numeral signs (4, 6), 3 are inverted capitals<br />
	(J, V, Y), 7 are minuscule or lower-case English letters, and the remaining 54 are about evenly<br />
	divided between modifications of English capitals (usually by the addition of one or more<br />
	strokes) and free inventions. Most of the latter consist of curve combinations somewhat in the<br />
	manner of rounded and heavily shaded English handwriting, but without being reducible to<br />
	specific letters of the alphabet.<br />
	KROEBER] STIMULUS DIFFUSION 5<br />
	served by a native, Doalu Bukere, who, having in his youth experienced a<br />
	few months of missionary schooling in English, set himself the task of devising<br />
	a system for his countrymen suited to their native language. As the<br />
	result of a divine dream, or during it, he devised a syllabic system of more<br />
	than 200 characters, which for a time found enthusiastic acceptance.4 It<br />
	is not necessary to go into this parallel case except to remark that if we<br />
	did not know its specific history, and if by any chance of history the Vai<br />
	had been cut off from continuance of European influence but had happened<br />
	to preserve their writing, its origin when discovered at some later time<br />
	would also undoubtedly have been a puzzle, and perhaps an insoluble one,<br />
	for historians.&#39;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	4.<span style="background-color:#ffff00;"> It is a natural step for inference to pass from these historic examples</span><br />
	<span style="background-color:#ffff00;">of the origin of systems of writing to those whose origin is still veiled in</span><br />
	<span style="background-color:#ffff00;">obscurity. Not that we can use the principle of idea-diffusion to assign a</span><br />
	<span style="background-color:#ffff00;">specific origin to Egyptian or Mesopotamian or Chinese writing, but the</span><br />
	<span style="background-color:#ffff00;">principle does at least come into consideration as a possibility. </span>Particularly<br />
	is this true when we find writing appearing on the cultural scene at more or<br />
	less the same time in countries so close together as Egypt and Mesopotamia.<br />
	<span style="background-color:#ffff00;">The time-space relation is such as inevitably to suggest a connection.</span> On<br />
	the other hand, the Egyptian and Mesopotamian characters, their sound<br />
	values where they represent sounds, and in part the principles employed<br />
	are so different that all attempts to derive cuneiform from hieroglyphic or<br />
	vice versa have been rejected as insufficient and forced. It is, however, entirely<br />
	possible that after writing had developed in one of the two areas,<br />
	knowledge of the possibility and advantages of writing was carried to the<br />
	other area; and that because of this stimulus someone in the second area<br />
	devised a system to fit his native language, customary thought processes,<br />
	and available technological materials; with the result that the specific system<br />
	evolved was totally or preponderantly diverse from the one which had<br />
	stimulated its invention. <span style="background-color:#ffff00;">As between Mesopotamia and China, the geographical</span><br />
	<span style="background-color:#ffff00;">gap is considerably greater, and the lapse of time between first</span></p>

	Africa, (1914).<br />
	1 In this case, only ten or a dozen characters bear resemblances to European letters or<br />
	numerals, and in practically no case is there complete identity of shape. Koelle&#39;s specimen of<br />
	the syllabary appears to be lithographed from his own hand-written copy from native text.<br />
	The strokes are heavy, and straight, angular, or in simple curves. Ellis&#39;s specimen is much<br />
	more cursive in quality. Whether it, or the original form, has been influenced by Arabic writing,<br />
	I am incompetent to say. Certainly Koelle&#39;s sample does not look so. But he makes clear<br />
	that the Vei were in contact with Mohammedans, and that the inventor recited Arabic prayers.<br />
	6 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 42, 1940</p>
<p>
	<span style="background-color:#ffff00;">appearances is probably also greater. </span>However, the system of strokes composing<br />
	the characters is undeniably somewhat alike. That Terrien de Lacouperie&#39;s<br />
	(https://archive.org/stream/earlychinesewrit00chalrich#page/n75/mode/2up)<br />
	old attempt to show a connection through specific similarities of<br />
	form and meaning of characters is a failure, may be unhesitatingly accepted<br />
	along with the majority of scholars. <span style="background-color:#ffff00;">Nevertheless, there does remain the</span><br />
	<span style="background-color:#ffff00;">possibility of a real connection through the transmission of the idea of writing</span><br />
	<span style="background-color:#ffff00;">and of this acting as a stimulus toward an original but induced local</span><br />
	<span style="background-color:#ffff00;">invention, presumably in China.</span></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	5. Even our own, the so-called <span style="background-color:#ffff00;">Phoenician alphabet</span>, may well have been<br />
	the product of this same process. It is well known that alphabetic symbols<br />
	for the complete consonantal scheme occur in Egyptian as a minor factor<br />
	within a system of several hundred characters, most of which denote syllables,<br />
	whole words, or ideas without reference to sound. This mixed system<br />
	had been in use for two thousand years before someone hit upon the idea<br />
	that ninety-five per cent of the apparatus of the Egyptian system could be<br />
	discarded and any or all words could be written, at least in their essential<br />
	consonantal outline, with twenty to twenty-five phonemic characters or<br />
	letters representing sound elements. In this case the essence of the invention<br />
	was the discarding of what was unnecessary. Once this idea entered the<br />
	mind of some Phoenician or other East Asiatic, he might conceivably have<br />
	taken over the Egyptian consonantal letters, or characters from cuneiform<br />
	or some other system of writing already in use, and started with these; their<br />
	form however changing, during the early development of the alphabet,<br />
	sufficiently that when we encounter the first preserved inscriptions some<br />
	centuries later, the letters are so altered that they cannot with certainty<br />
	be referred to Egyptian, cuneiform, or any other original models. <span style="background-color:#ffff00;">An alternative</span><br />
	<span style="background-color:#ffff00;">possibility is that the inventor started fresh: that he invented his</span><br />
	<span style="background-color:#ffff00;">symbols as well as his scheme; or, like Sequoya, only partially borrowed the</span><br />
	<span style="background-color:#ffff00;">already existing letter symbols. </span>If this is what happened it would of course<br />
	be impossible to derive the Phoenician alphabet from Egyptian or any<br />
	other writing by the usual method of tracing specific links of evidence, because<br />
	in that case the links of evidence never existed. <span style="background-color:#ffff00;">This second alternative</span><br />
	<span style="background-color:#ffff00;">must be recognized as a possibility</span>; and if continued efforts to derive<br />
	the Phoenician alphabet from other writings yield only negative results, the<br />
	possibility of its origin being due to stimulus-diffusion will be correspondingly<br />
	enhanced.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	6. The history of Japan furnishes several cases of possible stimulus diffusion<br />
	from China. There are of course many known cases of Japanese derivation<br />
	of cultural items and systems from China. The time required for<br />
	KROEBER] STIMULUS DIFFUSION 7<br />
	the transmissions varied heavily, ranging from about a century to a millennium<br />
	or more.6 This variability must be held in mind. It is not necessarily<br />
	an argument against a stimulus diffusion having occurred because a Japanese<br />
	institution appears later by a short interval or by a long interval than<br />
	the corresponding institution in China. In other words, decision as to the<br />
	authenticity of a possible connection must be made, in the main, on grounds<br />
	other than the lapse of time.<br />
	Three forms of dramatic art are recognized in Japan; the No or religious<br />
	drama, the puppet play, and the secular drama with human actors. The<br />
	last two, however, are best treated as one in the present connection because<br />
	they grew up and culminated simultaneously and in part had plays written<br />
	for them by the same authors. As a literary form, therefore, they are essentially<br />
	identical even though the stage performance is different. On the<br />
	other hand the No and the secular drama are separate growths. The No has<br />
	religious associations, is built up very considerably out of citations from<br />
	extant poetry, and was aristocratic in its sponsorship. The secular drama<br />
	does not attach to shrines or religious legend, creates its own poetry, and<br />
	appealed to the bourgeois or plebeian classes. The No originated toward the<br />
	end of the fourteenth century, reached its culmination early in the fifteenth,<br />
	and has been preserved ever since as a conscious and cultivated archaism.<br />
	The secular drama began to develop about 1600, reached its peak about<br />
	1700 with Chikamatsu, and then slowly declined in quality although continuing<br />
	to prosper in appeal. More or less is known about its origins: it grew<br />
	up locally out of at least two ingredients: public recitals accompanied by<br />
	music, or romances chanted in a sort of free verse; and dances for entertainment.<br />
	<br />
	The origin of Chinese drama appears to be very little known. Certain<br />
	literary legends may be discounted. It is, however, clear that this drama<br />
	suddenly appears in rather fullblown form and with wide appeal under the<br />
	Mongol Dynasty. However rapid its rise, the first development therefore<br />
	probably occurred before any literary recognition at all was accorded it.<br />
	Even subsequently the drama was never admitted to classic Chinese literature.<br />
	The earliest extant play, but one only, is ascribed to Sung times. The<br />
	florescence is put under the Mongol Dynasty, with some prolongation into<br />
	earlier Ming. We can safely say, therefore, that the origin falls into the<br />
	6 Thus, in approximate centuries, the lag is: block printing, 1; Sung style painting, 2-3;<br />
	end of retainer burial, 3; official recognition of Buddhism, 5; movable type printing, 5; NeoConfucian<br />
	philosophy, 5; money minting, 10; bronze, at least 11; writing, at least 15; abolition<br />
	of feudalism, 20.<br />
	8 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 42, 1940<br />
	thirteenth century, or at least not later than the thirteenth century, and<br />
	the culmination by or before 1400.<br />
	This allows an interval of a century between the Chinese drama and the<br />
	Japanese No, and of more than three centuries to the secular Japanese drama.<br />
	Of the two, the latter is more similar to the possible Chinese prototype.<br />
	The No is very thoroughly different in form, subject, manner, and status.<br />
	Nevertheless it is conceivable, especially in view of the constant drift of<br />
	features of Chinese culture to Japan, that the No represented an original<br />
	Japanese creation in response to the stimulus of knowledge of dramatic performances<br />
	in China. This is the more likely because the No was to a considerable<br />
	extent developed by two individuals, Kwen-ami and Se-ami Motokiyu,<br />
	father and son, who also brought its narrow and specialized form to<br />
	highest perfection. They would, in short, more or less correspond to Sequoya<br />
	as individual inventors. With the No it is not a question of broad currents<br />
	affecting a considerable segment of the Japanese population.<br />
	It is also possible that Chinese stimulus acted upon the later secular<br />
	drama rather than upon the No; or that it twice affected Japan.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	7. There is, however, another possibility for the secular Japanese drama:<br />
	European influence. The first origins of this drama are dated about<br />
	sixty years after the arrival of the Portuguese in Japan. By the time the<br />
	drama had developed well characterized forms, the policy of isolation was<br />
	in force. However, there remained one permanent Dutch trading colony,<br />
	and there were imports and exports, naturally mainly of specialties, curiosities,<br />
	and luxury articles. There was at any rate enough intercourse for the<br />
	possibility of knowledge of lay dramatic performances being introduced to<br />
	Japanese consciousness. Certain resemblances between the plays of Chikamatsu<br />
	and of Shakespeare have been noted. He has been called the Japanese<br />
	Shakespeare, not only because of his preeminence but because of<br />
	nameable qualities of resemblance such as in vigor, strength of dramatic<br />
	conception, and looseness of construction.&#39; These resemblances are too<br />
	vague to count for much as evidence of connection. It is extremely unlikely<br />
	that any translations of plays of Shakespeare reached Chikamatsu or his<br />
	associates, although they wrote a full century later. It is however conceivable<br />
	that with the knowledge which the Dutch continued to impart to at<br />
	least sections of the Japanese population, there may have been included<br />
	some knowledge, not necessarily wholly in the abstract, of dramatic performances.<br />
	The Dutch themselves possessed a school of drama which culminated<br />
	about the middle of the seventeenth century. It is clear that the<br />
	SW. G. Aston, Japanese Literature, 1899 (1933), p. 278.<br />
	KROEBER] STIMULUS DIFFUSION 9<br />
	evidence is too tenuous to allow of the case being pressed; but the possibility<br />
	of a connection by diffusion is sufficient to warrant further investigation.<br />
	I would not go so far as to suggest that the Japanese secular drama in<br />
	its entirety was due to European stimuli. Certainly the use of puppets was<br />
	not derived from Europe but from Asia. In the same way the plays with<br />
	living actors were gradually crystallizing out of dances and recitals, as a<br />
	native development, a century before Chikamatsu. I am suggesting nothing<br />
	more than that after the formation of dramatic patterns on a purely Japanese<br />
	basis was under way, the development may have been furthered and<br />
	precipitated by added European stimulus example.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	8. This case would accordingly be somewhat parallel to that on which<br />
	we have some evidence in the history of native pottery in what is now the<br />
	American Southwest. We possess a rather full archaeological record of<br />
	pottery in Pre-Pueblo and incipient Pueblo times in the San Juan drainage<br />
	in the Southwest. Unfired clay or mud with fiber temper was first used in<br />
	housebuilding, then for lining baskets, then in shapes of its own and with<br />
	sand replacing the vegetable tempering; only after which does fired pottery<br />
	appear, and then painting.8 If we had only this single piece of archaeological<br />
	history, we should inevitably conclude that pottery developed independently<br />
	and on the spot in the American Southwest. Nevertheless, the consensus<br />
	of American archaeologists has been to give greater weight to the<br />
	fact that Pueblo culture shows innumerable resemblances to that of Mexico.<br />
	Maize and probably most of the other cultivated plants are Mexican<br />
	in origin. Masonry buildings, ball courts, religious ritual, and the like have<br />
	Mexican parallels and almost certainly antecedents. The mass of such evidence<br />
	is so great that it cannot be left out of account. It is, therefore, entirely<br />
	possible that both explanations are true: that the ancient Pueblos or<br />
	Pre-Pueblos were groping toward pottery when they received the reinforcement<br />
	of more developed skills reaching them from Mexico.9 Or, it is conceivable<br />
	that the first gropings took place in an endeavor to reproduce<br />
	pottery which was known from the South but without precise knowledge<br />
	of the involved skills-something as Europeans groped for a time to imitate<br />
	Chinese porcelain.</p>

	9. Let us, however, return to Japan and the possible effect of European,<br />
	especially Dutch, influences. The Japanese seem to have remained unconscious<br />
	of their grammar until the latter half of the eighteenth century,<br />
	8 E. H. Morris, (American Museum of Natural History, Anthropological Papers, No. 28,<br />
	1927), pp. 125-198.<br />
	9 Or, according to excavations at Snaketown, from the Hohokam of southern Arizona, on<br />
	the route from Mexico.<br />
	10 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 42, 1940<br />
	when Motoori in 1779 started its development. His grammatical works appear<br />
	not to have been translated, and it is therefore impossible to adduce<br />
	internal evidence which might be decisive. The Japanese at any rate believe<br />
	that Motoori originated the conscious analysis of the structure of his native<br />
	language. Derivation or stimulus from China is out of the question because<br />
	there is no Chinese grammar. Native Chinese linguistic efforts were in the<br />
	nature of the case directed to description of the phonetic aspects of writing<br />
	and to discovery of the tones. These were accomplished in the third and<br />
	fifth centuries after Christ.<br />
	There was, however, during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries,<br />
	a small group of Japanese scholars who specialized in western learning<br />
	for the national benefit. They worked under tremendous handicaps,<br />
	both from lack of materials and of instructors. It does seem probable, however,<br />
	that at least one copy of a Latin or vernacular grammar or philological<br />
	work would have been among the number of books that reached this class<br />
	of western scholars. In fact it would be highly improbable that this had not<br />
	happened. And through this source a stimulus, a realization of the idea that<br />
	such a study as grammar was possible, perhaps even an actual model, however<br />
	imperfectly translated or understood, may have set Motoori&#39;s mind in<br />
	operation to make its original creation.<br />
	In this instance it is probable that proof or disproof can be brought. A<br />
	comparison of Motoori&#39;s grammatical works with Latin and Dutch grammars<br />
	of the preceding century might show decisively whether in his concepts<br />
	and categories he did or did not draw upon them-like Sequoya with<br />
	his English-shape characters.</p>

	10. The following is an instance of direct, not stimulus, diffusion, but<br />
	it has a certain <span style="background-color:#dda0dd;">pertinence</span>. In the thirteenth century, as the Sung Dynasty<br />
	was tottering toward its end, there developed in China a quite unique form<br />
	of algebra. This operates on principles pretty thoroughly different from<br />
	those of Greek, Arabic, and European algebra, and its antecedents are completely<br />
	obscure. When it emerges into the historic record, it is already functioning<br />
	in a well characterized pattern. Its development continued for about<br />
	two generations, reaching its climax just after 1300; beyond which no<br />
	further additions seem to have been made. The entire duration of the activity,<br />
	so far as is known, therefore, falls into the period 1245 to 1305. After<br />
	this it tended to go out of use. Sixteenth century scholars in commenting on<br />
	it showed that they no longer understood it; and still later, it dropped out of<br />
	scholarly mention. It was not until after 1800 that the Chinese were able to<br />
	recover the works of their greatest master in this field, Chu Shih-chieh,<br />
	partly from Korean sources.<br />
	KROEBER] STIMULUS DIFFUSION 11<br />
	At some time between 1300 and 1600, this algebraic art was carried to<br />
	Japan. Shortly after 1600 we find the Japanese beginning to take it up and<br />
	develop it further. The principles are those of thirteenth-century China,<br />
	but the Japanese quickly raised the art to a higher pitch. The greatest<br />
	master was Seki Kowa, 1642-1708, who has been compared to Newton, and<br />
	at any rate was a contemporary of Newton. This algebra continued through<br />
	the eighteenth century, in fact until 1868;10 but it seems to have exhausted<br />
	the fundamental possibilities of its pattern after 1750 and to have gone off<br />
	into specialties and refinements. The Japanese had apparently completed<br />
	the activity by the time they decided to westernize.<br />
	In this instance there is no doubt that the Japanese began where the<br />
	Chinese left off. There is continuity of specific activity and performance in<br />
	spite of the gap of three hundred years. But it is entirely obscure why this<br />
	algebra stopped developing in China before it had been pushed to its limits,<br />
	and why three centuries later, after they had presumably long had access<br />
	to the Chinese works on the subject, the Japanese suddenly took the activity<br />
	up and carried it farther. It may be added that in both cases the art<br />
	was of the people. That is to say, it did not emanate from the scholarly class<br />
	in China or the corresponding aristocracy in Japan. It did not enter into the<br />
	official educational system of either country. The participants were private<br />
	individuals and largely of the middle classes. In both countries too the art<br />
	was essentially an end in itself. It seems to have been used in relation neither<br />
	with scientific inquiry nor with technological development. This concentration<br />
	of the activity upon itself very likely helped its intermittent<br />
	flaring up and dying away.<br />
	As already said, this is not a case of stimulus diffusion; the connection<br />
	is proved. The specific stimuli that led first to the Chinese and then to the<br />
	Japanese growth are obscure. But the idea of such an algebra lay dormant<br />
	in Japan for some time, then suddenly became influential, and further development<br />
	resulted. It is the awakening of the idea or method, its revivification,<br />
	one might almost say its reinvention, that furnish a partial parallel<br />
	to the preceding cases.</p>

	11. A number of tantalizingly vague parallels between Greece and India<br />
	have long troubled culture historians. There may be other connections<br />
	which have not even been suspected. If, for instance, fifty years ago anyone</p>
<p>
	had ventured to assert specific Greek influences in Indian and Far East<br />
	Asiatic art, he would have received little attention. The discovery of actual<br />
	remains of Gandhara art in Northwestern India completely changed the<br />
	10 The last great name is Aida, 1747-1817; the last of the line, Hagiwara, 1828-1909.<br />
	12 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 42, 1940<br />
	situation. Here were abundant remains of sculpture from the earlier Christian<br />
	centuries, and ranging by all conceivable intergradations from almost<br />
	pure Hellenic or Graeco-Roman statuary to pure Buddhistic in the native<br />
	Indian manner. Discoveries in central Asia uncovered corresponding links<br />
	between Greek and Gandhara art and that of China and Japan. It is still<br />
	difficult for the layman to see any but the most vague resemblances between<br />
	a Chinese Kwan-yin and a European Madonna. The specific stylistic qualities<br />
	of European and Far Eastern art remain very fundamentally different<br />
	in two such pieces of statuary. Nevertheless the archaeologist and historian<br />
	of art can trace specific connections which cannot be denied. This is not<br />
	saying that a Kwan-yin is a Chinese attempt at a replica of the Madonna.<br />
	It does mean that specific influences within the field of sculpture, and probably<br />
	painting, did get across from the Far West to the Far East. How far<br />
	the western influences are responsible for the beginnings of plastic art in<br />
	India and China, and how far they merely shaped and colored native developments<br />
	that were already under way, is another question, and one that<br />
	is harder to answer; partly because historians take up most of their time<br />
	either in proving the specific connections, or in having to speculate about<br />
	the scanty evidence that remains from the period previous to western influences.<br />
	<br />
	At any rate, one inference may be drawn from this example: that contacts<br />
	did occur and that they did have influence far beyond what we could<br />
	directly infer from the preserved documentary literature. In other words<br />
	the absence of direct historical records as to connections between Greece<br />
	and India is no proof that there was no connection.<br />
	Whether the Hindu drama was derived from or stimulated by the Greek<br />
	drama has long been a matter of debate. The dates permit of such a derivation.<br />
	The earliest Indian references are to the first century after Christ, the<br />
	earliest preserved specimens from the second, and the culmination occurred<br />
	under Kalidasa soon after the beginning of the fifth. The time interval is<br />
	therefore ample for connections to have been operative. The internal evidence<br />
	is inconclusive. Direct historical testimony is completely lacking.<br />
	Western recorders would not have been much interested whether the classic<br />
	Greek plays performed in the Greek Bactrian kingdom about 200 B.c. were or<br />
	were not followed by Sanskrit imitations in India three or four centuries later.<br />
	Nor would the Hindus, with their culturally self-centered attitude, be interested<br />
	in the fact that the beginnings of their drama had been stimulated<br />
	from abroad. The question has been reviewed at length by Winternitz&quot; on<br />
	n Geschichte der Indischen Literatur, 3: 174 seq., 1920.<br />
	KROEBER] STIMULUS DIFFUSION 13<br />
	the basis of previous monographic studies.12 His conclusion is ambiguous.<br />
	There does seem to be agreement that if there was influence it was not from<br />
	the great classic drama of Sophocles and Aristophanes or Menander but<br />
	more likely from the later Greek mimus. We can leave the matter there.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	12. At an earlier period we find the Pythagorean theorem appearing in<br />
	the Hindu Sulva-sutras. As usual in India, the date of the Sulva-sutras is<br />
	highly problematical: the range of estimates is from the eighth century<br />
	before to the second after Christ.13 The theorem appears in quite different<br />
	context, in connection with the construction of altars, and in a number of<br />
	numerical applications instead of as an abstract geometric theorem. On the<br />
	other side there are elements in the Pythagorean cult which have generally<br />
	been construed as non-Greek: the reputed transmigration of souls, for instance,<br />
	the taboos on certain foods, the whole cult or school-like character<br />
	of the movement. The question accordingly is in this case a two-way one:<br />
	did some knowledge of incipient Greek geometry reach India to be embodied<br />
	in the Sulva-sutras; or did Indian philosophy affect Pythagorean<br />
	mathematics, doctrine, and cult?</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	13. Soon after Buddha&#39;s death monastic orders seem to have been in<br />
	full operation in India.<span style="background-color:#ffff00;"> It was ascetics in retirement from profane affairs</span><br />
	<span style="background-color:#ffff00;">that seem at all times to have directed the historic fortunes of Buddhism.</span><br />
	In the west there were monastic communities in Palestine at the time of<br />
	Christ: the Jewish Essenes since about 150 B.c.; and definite monastic organizations<br />
	became prominent fairly early in the history of Christianity,<br />
	especially in fourth-century Egypt. The principle got a firm hold in Latin<br />
	Christianity only some centuries later and did not reach its full development<br />
	there until the high Middle Ages. <span style="background-color:#ffff00;">So far as I know there is no proved</span><br />
	<span style="background-color:#ffff00;">historic link between Buddhistic Monasticism and Near Eastern-Christian</span><br />
	<span style="background-color:#ffff00;">monasticism; but the relation of space and time, as well as of intrinsic concept,</span><br />
	<span style="background-color:#ffff00;">is such as to make one inevitably think of a connection. </span>After all<br />
	the fundamental idea of the institution is a simple one, and it need not have<br />
	impressed more than one or two individuals of unusual intensity of conviction<br />
	and persuasiveness, for them to apply it in the setting of an entirely<br />
	different religion, and, when the &quot;time became ripe,&quot; for the institution to<br />
	take root and flourish.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	14. I might mention one other possibility of Greek-Indian connections<br />
	of the type which we are discussing: the development of quantitative meter<br />
	in India. As is well known, all Greek poetry, so far back as we have record<br />
	of it, is quantitative. Latin poetry made itself quantitative in direct imita-<br />
	1 Such as H. Reich, Der Mimus.<br />
	13 Further, the older and younger portions may differ in age by as much as three centuries.<br />
	14 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 42, 1940<br />
	tion. Classic Sanskrit poetry is also quantitative. The two great Sanskrit<br />
	epics, on the other hand, count syllables, but they do not arrange long and<br />
	short syllables into rhythmic patterns. The basic plan of verse structure is<br />
	much as in the Romance languages, where form is also determined by the<br />
	number of syllables but without consideration of whether the syllables are<br />
	long or short. Roughly, it may be said that Sanskrit poetry of the preChristian<br />
	centuries counted syllables, that of the post-Christian centuries<br />
	measured them.<br />
	Now the question arises whether this development in India represents<br />
	an internal growth or may also possibly have been stimulated from Greece.<br />
	The former is usually assumed. However, if on fuller analysis of data it<br />
	should prove more positively probable that Hindu drama or early Hindu<br />
	mathematics, or both, were influenced from Greece, the presumption of a<br />
	connection in the matter of verse form would obviously also be strengthened.<br />
	Not that a case can ever be proved by parallel ones; but the prospect<br />
	of an additional connection being provable is necessarily enhanced by previous<br />
	cases. I admit that origination from mere stimulus is more difficult to<br />
	conceive in the case of the fundamental form of poetry than for most of the<br />
	matters so far considered. One would imagine that before a new and strange<br />
	verse form could appeal sufficiently to anyone for him to wish to apply it in<br />
	his native language whose poetry was based on other forms, he would have<br />
	to be subjected to considerable exposure to the alien type. Strictly, therefore,<br />
	in such an instance we would have stimulus plus exposure. It seems<br />
	doubtful whether the idea alone and as such could take root in a new special<br />
	medium. In the case of Latin quantitative meter we know that this was introduced<br />
	by Greeks or by South Italians who had been under Greek influence;<br />
	and it seems almost inescapable that there were non-Greek Italians<br />
	and even some Romans who knew Greek and had been exposed to the swing<br />
	of Greek poetry in the first half of the third century when the innovation<br />
	began to be introduced. But from what we know of the general historic setting<br />
	it can hardly be imagined that the few Greeks in India or the fewer<br />
	Greek-speaking Hindus set themselves to introduce quantitative meter in<br />
	India. The mechanism, therefore, remains obscure even if we entertain the<br />
	possibility of the fact.<br />
	Classic Persian poetry of the Middle Ages is also quantitative. This<br />
	makes four great Indo-European literatures whose poetry is built up on the<br />
	quantitative principle. It has therefore sometimes been supposed, and was<br />
	natural to suppose, that quantity as a poetical instrument was an original<br />
	Indo-European inheritance which spontaneously came to the surface as<br />
	soon as literature reached sufficient development. However, quantity in<br />
	KROEBER] STIMULUS DIFFUSION 15<br />
	Persian literature was quite evidently taken over directly from Arabic, just<br />
	as were rhyme and strophic forms and many themes. What happened here,<br />
	accordingly, is a parallel of what happened in Latin; with only this reversal,<br />
	that the influenced Romans were the conquering people and the influenced<br />
	Persians the conquered nationality. Nevertheless, with two of our four cases<br />
	eliminated, it is clear that the interpretation of the spontaneous growth of<br />
	quantitative verse out of something inherent in the nature of Indo-European<br />
	speech, must be abandoned. If we add the fact that early Sanskirt<br />
	poetry is not quantitative and that the first appearance of quantity in<br />
	India is centuries later than in Greece, it does look as if the situation called<br />
	for an examination of the problem whether all Indo-European quantitative<br />
	verse may not go back to a single origin among the Greeks.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	15. However, the problem is not yet finished. Arabic poetry, so far back<br />
	as we know it, is also quantitative. We have preserved the works of a number<br />
	of Arab poets from the century before Mohammed. These works show<br />
	a very definite form indicative of a previous development; but all record of<br />
	earlier stages has been lost. Through the accidents of the fortunes of historical<br />
	preservation we therefore have quantitative Arab verse appearing<br />
	suddenly about 500 A.D. Now how did such a special form-pattern grow up<br />
	in backward Arabia? Earlier Semitic and Hamitic poetry does not seem to<br />
	rest on quantity. Its forms are both less strict and quite different. In 500<br />
	A.D., however, the Arabs had been just beyond the frontier of the Hellenic<br />
	civilized world for eight centuries. It does seem at least possible that in some<br />
	manner of which all record has been lost, the quantitative pattern of poetry<br />
	managed in these eight centuries to get itself transferred from one language<br />
	to an entirely different and unrelated one, and from highly civilized to definitely<br />
	backward peoples. I admit that on first impression such a hypothesis<br />
	seems fantastic. It violates all our preconceptions as to the embedding<br />
	of poetic form in speech medium. Further, it must be granted that in this<br />
	case the mechanism of transfer to a non-Indo-European language is more<br />
	difficult to imagine than between the common Indo-European languages of<br />
	Greece and India; though as the quantitative pattern passed from Arabic<br />
	to Persian, it might also have passed from Greek to Arabic. Moreover, there<br />
	is in this case no geographical gap as between Greece and India: the Arabs<br />
	and the Greeks of Syria and the Roman Empire were in actual permanent<br />
	contact and communications. I therefore submit the possibility for what it<br />
	may be worth. Further knowledge may strengthen or eliminate it.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	16. While we are on the subject of poetical form, a few words may be<br />
	said about rhyme. The origin of this is a vexed problem. It appears, apparently<br />
	independently, in Arabic and in early Latin church poetry. It appears<br />
	16 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 42, 1940<br />
	gradually, and considerably later, in the vernaculars of Europe, often after<br />
	passing through the stage of half-rhyme or assonance. I do not wish to enter<br />
	into the difficult problem of interrelationships between these literatures.<br />
	There is intricate evidence that bears on these problems and I am incompetent<br />
	to handle it. We do know, however, that Persian poetry, beginning<br />
	about 900, grew up in imitation of Arabic poetry and took rhyme over from<br />
	it along with other features. Somewhat later, toward the twelfth century,<br />
	rhyme begins to appear in India, and the later poetry of India, especially<br />
	in the vernacular, is both rhymed and quantitative. In fact, the Hindus<br />
	characteristically pushed the device toward its logical limit, demanding<br />
	double-syllable rhyme and often using triple. In the works which I have<br />
	consulted I do not recall a direct statement to the effect that Indian rhyme<br />
	was taken over from Persia. But in view of both the geography and of what<br />
	we know of relations after 1000, all the probabilities would be against the<br />
	Hindus having developed their rhyme independently. Presumably the principal<br />
	historical problem would be whether they derived it from Persian<br />
	poetry alone or from both Persian and Arabic.<br />
	So that I may not be interpreted as advocating a single origin for every<br />
	set of related phenomena in history, I wish to add that there is one other<br />
	development of rhyme which I consider unquestionably independent of<br />
	those so far mentioned. In China rhyme is well marked in the earliest preserved<br />
	examples of literature. This antedates by a millennium and a half<br />
	the first known examples in Arabic or Latin. Moreover, the nature of the<br />
	Chinese language is such, with its phonetically limited number of syllables,<br />
	which are also words, that both rhyme and syllable-counting were devices<br />
	that were bound to be obtrusive. A third factor which is ready to hand in<br />
	Chinese, and available to serve poetic form, is tone. However, the Chinese<br />
	did not become formally conscious of their tones until the late fifth century,14<br />
	and soon thereafter, by or during early T&#39;ang times, did add them to<br />
	their repertory of poetic devices.<br />
	It is accordingly impossible for rhyme in China to be derived from<br />
	rhyme in the west; and while the reverse is theoretically possible, I am not<br />
	even suggesting it. The gap in time and in space is too great. Moreover, it<br />
	would be unfortunate to adopt a negativistic attitude toward independent<br />
	origins. All I am arguing in this essay is that independent origins are not<br />
	necessarily proved because we are unable to prove specific connection by<br />
	specific historical documents. There is bound to be a category of cases<br />
	which are indeterminate, or indeterminate at present; and what I am pro-<br />
	14 Discovery attributed to Shen Yo, 441-513.<br />
	KROEBER] STIMULUS DIFFUSION 17<br />
	pounding is that in at least part of these indeterminate situations the principle<br />
	of stimulus diffusion may have been operative.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	17. As Chinese tones have just been mentioned it may be worth dwelling<br />
	upon them a few moments longer. It is really rather remarkable in the<br />
	abstract that the Chinese should not have been aware of their tones until<br />
	the fifth century after Christ. It is of course theoretically conceivable that<br />
	older Chinese was non-tonal and that the recognition of tones came late because<br />
	the tones developed late. However, I do not know that any authority<br />
	has suggested this, and it seems unlikely for as late as post-Christian times.<br />
	I will therefore venture another suggestion. That the Chinese did not develop<br />
	a grammar or linguistic analysis of their spoken language is natural<br />
	enough in view of the extreme paucity of strictly grammatical features in<br />
	Chinese. They did, however, possess an intricate system of writing their<br />
	language, and from a fairly early time devoted considerable effort, as well<br />
	as ingenuity, to organizing their knowledge of the written system. After<br />
	about the beginning of the Christian era Buddhist influences became strong<br />
	in China. The Buddhist texts were in Sanskrit, and along with the texts, or<br />
	following them, there was introduced some knowledge of grammar as<br />
	worked out in Sanskrit. This form of grammar would have been both difficult<br />
	and sterile to apply outright to Chinese. But I suggest that what may<br />
	be called philological curiosity and interest were stimulated by it; that the<br />
	Chinese for the first time became speech-conscious as well as writing-conscious;<br />
	and that the result was the discovery of the tone system which is so<br />
	characteristic of their speech. Theoretically this case is&#39;of some interest because<br />
	if my suggestion is valid, Panini, who lived in Northern India probably<br />
	between the sixth and fourth centuries s.c., is brought into historic<br />
	connection with Shen Yo, who discovered tones in China toward 500 A.D.<br />
	The results of their activities are necessarily so different on account of the<br />
	divergence of the languages, that ordinary inferential historical evidence<br />
	would prove nothing as to the connection if the connection did exist. Historic<br />
	documentation could give us evidence upon this problem only if it happened<br />
	to be so precise as to give us details as to the training and educational<br />
	influences&#39;to which Shen Yo and his predecessors were exposed.<br />
	It is, of course, on the whole easier for a foreigner than for a native to<br />
	become conscious of the structure of a language. In principle, therefore, it is<br />
	entirely conceivable that the first recognition of tones in Chinese was not<br />
	made by Shen Yo, to whom the discovery is attributed, but by Indian or<br />
	other non-Chinese Buddhist monks who learned Chinese in order to translate<br />
	their scriptures into it, and that Shen Yo is simply that Chinese scholar<br />
	who first became aware of what the foreign missionaries had recognized</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	18 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 42, 1940<br />
	and thought it worth-while or profitable to announce to his countrymen.<br />
	According to the usual accounts, the addition of the new or tonal poetry<br />
	to the older verse forms came in with the T&#39;angs. This would be roughly a<br />
	century after Shen Yo&#39;s so-called discovery. T&#39;ang literature was tonal poetry<br />
	written by men trained in scholarship. It is therefore entirely possible<br />
	that the addition represented a conscious experiment: a transfer from formal<br />
	philology to formal poetry. On the other hand, it may be believed that<br />
	in China as elsewhere changes did not always originate at the top; that<br />
	there may have been developments which went on below the surface and<br />
	were given official and literary recognition only after they became an accomplished<br />
	fact. It might therefore be that both the philological recognition<br />
	of tone and the use of tone in poetry are only common functions of<br />
	such a sub-official growth. Which alternative is the truer one could perhaps<br />
	be readily determined by any competent Sinologist interested in bringing<br />
	together all the relevant data.</p>

	18. The whole history, the world over, of the growth of linguistic selfconsciousness<br />
	to the point of the development of an analysis of structure, or<br />
	what is ordinarily called grammar, seems to go back to a small number of<br />
	origins. Arabic grammar is derived from the Greek, probably via Syrian;<br />
	and Hebrew grammar is patterned after Arabic and follows it in time. The<br />
	various European vernaculars one after the other had their grammars determined<br />
	after the analogy of Latin and Greek, or of one another. Modern<br />
	comparative linguistics is little more than a century and a half old and essentially<br />
	represents the extension of analysis of languages first examined<br />
	individually. If we tentatively accept the suggestion just advanced that<br />
	Chinese philology is derived by stimulation from Indian sources, and Japanese<br />
	from European, there remain not over two wholly separate first origins<br />
	of grammatical study: one in Greece, the other in India. This immediately<br />
	brings up the question whether these two cannot be connected.<br />
	Priority in time certainly goes to India. The date of Panini has been<br />
	variously estimated from the eighth to the fourth century.15 Whatever his<br />
	absolute time, Panini represents a refined development, not a first beginning.<br />
	His grammar is very thoroughly worked out, skillful, and technically<br />
	competent. It must have had predecessors; and he refers to predecessors.<br />
	In Greece we find the first timid grammatical conceptualizations appearing<br />
	toward the end of the fifth century. By the time of Aristotle the system has<br />
	developed somewhat but is still far from complete. It is not until the second<br />
	1 350 B.C. is the most usual estimate, the fifth century has some support, and the seventh<br />
	and even eighth centuries have been suggested. His predecessor, Yaska, is mostly set somewhere<br />
	between 700 and 400.<br />

	century before Christ that Greek grammar in its full classic form was<br />
	worked out by Crates and Dionysios. It is probably significant that this<br />
	completion was the work of a Cilician and a Thracian: that is, of men to<br />
	whom Greek presumably was an acquired rather than a mother tongue, or<br />
	who at any rate were probably bi-lingual. It is psychologically less difficult<br />
	to analyze a system in whose use one has not become automatic.<br />
	However, I hesitate to draw the inference that Greek grammar owes its<br />
	development even partly to stimulation from the earlier Sanskrit example.<br />
	The case would be much stronger if we had positive knowledge of other<br />
	diffusions in the same direction, either direct or idea diffusions. Internal evidence,<br />
	in the shape of apparently borrowed categories, seems also to be<br />
	lacking. Perhaps it has not been looked for; at any rate it has not been adduced.<br />
	And finally we have the hesitant developmental steps within Greek<br />
	itself. Per se, this argument need not be conclusive. I have refused to accept<br />
	it as decisive in the case of Southwestern pottery. But as a reinforcement<br />
	of lack of other evidence, it must have some weight. It would perhaps<br />
	be going too far to make a positive pronouncement in favor of complete independence<br />
	of the Greek and Indian growths of grammar. It is always impossible<br />
	to predict what new evidence, or the analysis of old evidence from<br />
	a new point of view, may bring forth. Still, the situation appears to resolve<br />
	itself preponderantly in favor of no connection.</p>
<p>
	I am fully aware that the principle of stimulus or idea diffusion can be<br />
	abused. It could easily be invoked for wildly speculative leaps of historic<br />
	fantasy. However, this cannot be helped. <span style="background-color:#ffff00;">Those who will speculate on minimal</span><br />
	<span style="background-color:#ffff00;">evidence will no doubt continue to do so whether they use the principle</span><br />
	<span style="background-color:#ffff00;">of stimulus diffusion or some other principle as a pole with which to</span><br />
	<span style="background-color:#ffff00;">vault.</span> If stimulus diffusion does take place, it is a process which it is necessary<br />
	to recognize. Some focusing of attention on it as a principle will no<br />
	doubt help to delimit its nature and its scope. Any over-estimations of the<br />
	principle may be expected to show themselves as such, and ultimately to<br />
	help in the delimiting. After all, in the last analysis it is a matter in each<br />
	case of how much evidence there is, and whether the evidence is construed<br />
	with ordinary reasonableness.</p>
<p>
	<br />
	It is also well to remember that while diffusion in space, like transmission<br />
	in time, is an exceedingly common process, it is not something that<br />
	operates automatically. There are selective factors making for and against<br />
	diffusion, of which we are beginning to have some comprehension. There<br />
	are also a number of mechanisms involved in the process; and these it is obviously<br />
	desirable to distinguish, as far as possible. Idea diffusion is only one<br />
	20 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 42, 1940<br />
	of these mechanisms, and probably a rather special one. After all, diffusion<br />
	happens so frequently and so continuously that we know more about its<br />
	results than about its operation. We can often be sure that diffusion has<br />
	been effective, as evidenced by internal part-for-part similarities, when we<br />
	can only guess its route or carriers or reasons. More understanding of the<br />
	types of mechanism through which the generic diffusion process operates<br />
	will certainly be worth having; even though in the case of the particular<br />
	mechanism here discussed we may mostly be on difficult ground. Stimulus<br />
	diffusion may be provable in only a minority of the cases in which we can<br />
	suspect it. But we do have some indubitable instances of its operation. I<br />
	suggest nothing further than the desirability of open-mindedness toward<br />
	other possible instances. With more awareness of the mechanism and more<br />
	experience in dealing with it, we should gradually become better able to<br />
	distinguish the probable and the improbable instances of its operation.</p>
<p>
	Finally, the process is of interest because it combines development within<br />
	a culture with influence from outside. It contains the element of invention<br />
	in the wider sense, as well as that of diffusion of a special kind. What<br />
	is really involved in every true example of stimulus diffusion is the birth of<br />
	a pattern new to the culture in which it develops, though not completely<br />
	new in human culture. There is historical connection and dependence, but<br />
	there is also originality. Analogically, <span style="background-color:#ffff00;">ordinary diffusion is like adoption,</span><br />
	<span style="background-color:#ffff00;">stimulus diffusion like procreation</span>, with the influencing culture in the r6le<br />
	of the father; though by strict rules of historical evidence paternity is sometimes<br />
	clouded. <span style="background-color:#ffff00;">In essence, stimulus diffusion might be defined as new pattern</span><br />
	<span style="background-color:#ffff00;">growth initiated by precedent in a foreign culture.</span>16<br />

	16 Two other possible instances might be mentioned. One, which I owe to the suggestion<br />
	of Paul Benedict, is the historically wholly isolated script, or rather scripts, of the Lolos in<br />
	China. The other is the rise of Christian iconoclasm in Byzantium about a century after this<br />
	empire came into contact with image-condemning and puritan Mohammedanism.</p>
