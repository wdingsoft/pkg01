The Ancient Egyptians invented writing during the fourth millennium B.C. They started by writing on pieces of stone or bone, and later were able to make papyrus sheets from the stems of the plant Cyperus papyrus. Later, parchment or gazelle skin was used as well. Here we have a fragment of the Bible containing 32 pages of the New Testament written on parchment.PRESENT LOCATION	BIBLIOTHECA ALEXANDRINA ANTIQUETIES MUSEUM [01/027] ALEXANDRIA BAAMINVENTORY NUMBER	522DATING	BYZANTINE PERIODARCHAEOLOGICAL SITE	AKHMIMCATEGORY	PARCHMENTMATERIAL	LEATHERTECHNIQUE	WRITTEN WITH A REED PEN/REED WITH SPLIT NIB	WIDTH	16 cm
