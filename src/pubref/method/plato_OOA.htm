				<strong>Object Oriented Programming represents a paradigm shift away from the traditional modular programming methodologies that have prevailed since the advent of computers</strong><strong>. While today&rsquo;s computer scientists are undoubtedly clever chaps, the intrinsic concepts underpinning </strong><strong>Object Oriented Programming were actually considered almost 2,500 years in the dialogues of Plato!</strong></p>
			<p>
				Now, it is extremely doubtful as to whether the architects of <strong>Object Orientated Programming</strong> (<acronym title="Object Orientated Programming">OOP</acronym>) were aware of these prior concepts, as the stereotypical computer scientist is not normally renowned for his classical education. However, even if they weren&rsquo;t aware, there does seem to be a remarkable correlation between the thought processes of <strong>Plato</strong> and the later day <strong>software architects</strong>, even separated across the millennia.</p>
			<p>
				&nbsp;</p>
			<h2>
				Ancient Greek Philosophy</h2>
			<p>
				<strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato" target="_blank">Plato</a></strong> was born in Athens, <strong>Greece</strong> in the year <strong>428 <acronym title="Before Christian Era">BCE</acronym></strong> and was tutored by <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates" target="_blank">Socrates</a></strong> (often credited as the father of <strong>Western philosophy</strong>). However, it is Plato, not Socrates, who is arguably the best known of the ancient Greek philosophers (if not of all philosophers), due in large to his profound influence on modern philosophy through his legacy of prolific writings; <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato#Plato.27s_Dialogues" target="_blank">35 dialogues</a></strong> and <strong>13 letters</strong>.</p>
			<p>
				While Plato&rsquo;s writings cover many philosophical subjects, it is his radical <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics" target="_blank">metaphysical</a></strong> concepts, developed throughout his many dialogues, that are of particular interest in our comparisons with object oriented programming. Fundamentally, it is Plato&rsquo;s <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_Forms" target="_blank">theory of forms</a></strong> that is directly analogous to the foundations of OOP.</p>
			<h3>
				Theory of Forms</h3>
			<p>
				Throughout his metaphysical discussions, Plato refers to <strong>forms</strong> as abstract representations that are <strong>templates</strong> or <strong><span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD3">patterns</span></strong> for <strong>real world objects</strong> or <strong>characteristics of objects</strong>.</p>
			<p>
				By way of example, to explain the concept of a form, Plato discusses the concept of beauty. A flower is beautiful and a picture can also be said to be beautiful, but neither are beauty itself. Plato argues that the <strong>form&nbsp; of true beauty</strong> exists independently of the objects that have it, as such we may have a notion of perfect beauty, but can never actually experience it first hand.</p>
			<p>
				In Plato&rsquo;s parlance, a flower is said to <strong>partake</strong> of the form of beauty. It&rsquo;s beautiful, but we never see true beauty. The flower is said to be a <strong>particular</strong> that <strong>inherits</strong> its qualities from the forms, one of which is beauty.</p>
			<p>
				The form of true beauty is constant and unchanging, whereas a flower may possess beauty for a while, but ultimately looses it when it withers and dies. Being abstract, <strong>forms </strong><strong>exist independently</strong> of the particulars or real world objects that inherit their qualities.</p>
			<p>
				Heavy stuff at the best of times, let alone for over two millennia ago.</p>
			<h2>
				Computer Programming</h2>
			<h3>
				<strong>The Traditional Approach</strong></h3>
			<p>
				<strong>Computer programs</strong> are essentially a <strong>list of instructions</strong> to be followed in a pre described order by a computer; do A, then do B etc.. A bit like following a cooking <span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD5">recipe</span> <span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD4">step by step</span>.</p>
			<p>
				As computers became more advanced, their associated software programmes also became much longer and quite cumbersome. Quite often, a computer would need to run the same bit of code again and again. So, rather than rewrite this bit of code every time it was required, <strong>functions</strong> or <strong>procedures</strong> were written as semi-isolated pieces of code that could be called upon whenever they were required. This helped software develop in a <strong>modular</strong> fashion, with individual modules being responsible for certain computational procedures.</p>
			<h3>
				Object Orientated Programming</h3>
			<p>
				Object Orientated Programming took modules to the next level, with the modules becoming <strong>self contained</strong> pieces of code called <strong>classes</strong>.</p>
			<p>
				A <strong>class</strong> is a piece of computer program that serves as a <strong>template</strong> for the <strong>creation of an object</strong> in exactly the same way that Plato&rsquo;s <strong>forms</strong> were abstract philosophical <strong>templates</strong> for <strong>real world objects</strong>. The piece of code, or class, is <strong>not</strong> the object itself, but like the Platonic form, merely a <strong><span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD2">pattern</span> </strong>describing what the <strong>object</strong> will actually be like and what <strong>properties</strong> it will have when created. Exactly the same concept as Plato&rsquo;s, just transposed to a different discipline and separated by 2,500 years!</p>
			<p>
				Similar to Plato&rsquo;s hierarchical system of forms, these classes or templates can be enhanced.<strong> Expanded classes</strong> can be created, <strong>inheriting</strong> all the properties of the parent class, but enhancing it with additional properties to create a new &ldquo;child&rdquo; class containing all of it&rsquo;s parents properties, plus a load more of its own:</p>

				This is an extremely simplified example, but hopefully the concept of <strong>classes</strong> and <strong>objects</strong> and their associated analogies to the Platonic <strong>forms</strong> and <strong>particulars</strong> can be seen.</p>
			<h2>
				Nothing is New</h2>
			<p>
				So, whilst we may think that we&rsquo;re the cleverest generation to walk on the face of this planet, it may be worth pausing a while to reflect an try to gain a little humility, as we may often just be taking a <strong>new slant on old ideas</strong>.</p>
			<p>
				Even the bible, in Ecclesiastes 1:9-10, recognises this:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					<em>Nothing is new under the sun. Even the thing of which we say, &ldquo;See, this is new!&rdquo; has already existed in the ages that preceded us.</em></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Great scientists and thinkers of the past have also acknowledged this fact. Even <strong>Isaac Newton</strong> paid homage to the inspiration of his predecessors:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					<em>&ldquo;If I have seen a little further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants.&rdquo;</em></p>
			</blockquote>
			<h3>
				Seeking Inspiration</h3>
			<p>
				If you&rsquo;re struggling to come up with an answer to an intransigent problem, or want to find a new way of doing things, perhaps you could do worse than brushing up on your classical education in search of inspiration.</p>
			<p>
				By studying history, even in <strong>different disciplines</strong> to your own, you may come across ideas that could transpose into your own field of expertise and take you in <span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD1">directions</span> that you would never have dreamed of. They even have a name for the process, they call it the <strong>cross fertilisation of ideas</strong>.</p>
			<p>
				So, next time you&rsquo;re a little stuck with a problem, where will you turn to for your inspiration? Plato, Aristotle&hellip;</p>

				<b>Some Main Points of Aristotle&#39;s Thought </b></p>
		</center>
		<p>
			<u>A. The Criticism of Plato&#39;s Theory of Forms: </u></p>
		<p>
			In general, Aristotle thought that Plato&#39;s theory of forms with its<span style="background-color:#ffff00;"> two separate realms</span> failed to explain what it was meant to explain. That is, it failed to explain how there could be permanence and order in <b><u>this</u></b> world and how we could have objective knowledge of <b><u>this</u></b> world. By separating the realm of forms so radically from the material realm, Plato made it impossible to explain how the realm of forms made objectivity and permanence possible in the material realm. The objectivity and permanence of the realm of forms does not help to explain the material world because the connection between the two worlds is so hard to understand. The theory of forms, therefore, is an unnecessary proposal. There is no need to split the world up into two separate realms in order to explain objectivity and permanence in our experience.</p>
		<p>
			Aristotle elaborated this general criticism into two more particular objections:</p>
		<p>
			1. <u>The obscurity of the notion of participation or imitation: </u></p>
		<dl>
			<dd>
				According to Plato, material objects participate in or imitate the forms. It is in virtue of this relation to the realm of forms that material objects are knowable and have order. Yet, Aristotle argues, it is almost impossible to explain what exactly this participation or imitation is. The properties that the forms have (eternal, unchanging, transcendent, etc. ) are all incompatible with material objects. How, for example, can a white object be said to participate in or copy the form of whiteness? Is the form of whiteness white itself? How can there be whiteness without any <u>thing</u> which is white? What can a white object and the form of whiteness be said to have in common? It seems that the metaphor of imitation or participation seems to break down in these cases because of the special properties that Plato ascribes to the forms. The only link between the realm of forms and the material world, then, breaks down. The forms cannot explain anything in the material world.</dd>
		</dl>
		<p>
			2. <u>The third man argument: </u></p>
		<dl>
			<dd>
				This argument, like the first one, was first given by Plato himself in his later dialogues. It is related to the first objection, but is a more technical way of getting at the main problem with the theory of forms. The resemblance between any two material objects is explained by Plato in terms of their joint participation in a common form. A red book and a red flower, for example, resemble each other in virtue of being copies of the form of redness. Because they are copies of this form, they also resemble the form. But this resemblance between the red object and the form of redness must also be explained in terms of another form. What form does a red object and the form of redness both copy to account for their similarity? One can see that this will lead to an infinite regress. Whenever someone proposes another form that two similar things copy, you can always ask them to explain the similarity between the form and the objects. This will always require another form. The notion of imitation or copying used in the theory of forms, then, runs into logical difficulties. The theory of forms really explains nothing about the similarity of objects; another form is always needed beyond the one proposed. Thus to explain the similarity between a man and the form of man, one needs a third form of man, and this always requires another form. The explanation of the original similarity is never given; it is only put off to the next level.</dd>
		</dl>
		<p>
			<u>B. Aristotle&#39;s theory of form and matter: </u></p>
		<p>
			Aristotle, then, thought that in order to explain coherence and objective knowledge in this world, form must be located in particular individual objects. Yet, he still had to explain how things could change, how they could have permanence, and how we could have knowledge. He still had to address the problem of reconciling the objective and subjective views of the world. Instead of splitting the world into two separate realms, Aristotle divides objects into two parts or aspects: form and matter. All objects are composed of a certain material arranged in a certain way. The material they are composed of is their matter. The way it is arranged is their form. Take as an example a<span style="background-color:#ffff00;"> child playing with building blocks. The child could use the same blocks to first build a wall, and then tear it down and build a house. The material or matter in each case would be the same, the blocks. Yet, the house and the wall have the matter arranged in different ways. They have different forms. The house is still just one material object; yet it has two different aspects, its form and its matter.</span></p>
		<p>
			All objects then have matter, or the material of which they are composed, and form, the way the matter is arranged. It is the form of a thing, however, that makes a thing what it is. When the child knocked down the block wall, the blocks or matter remained. The wall no longer existed, however, because the blocks no longer had the arrangement or form characteristic of a wall. It is the form of an object that makes it the particular object that it is.</p>
		<p>
			It is also the form of a thing that we know when we have knowledge of it. To know a wall or a person is to know the peculiar arrangement of matter or their form. This is what makes them what they are.</p>
		<p>
			<u>Aristotle also uses this distinction to explain how there can be both permanence and change in the world</u>:</p>
		<p>
			<u>Explanation of Change</u>: Change can occur because t<span style="background-color:#ffff00;">he same matter can be arranged in different ways</span>. When the block wall was destroyed the matter, the blocks, remained. In change, therefore,<span style="background-color:#ffff00;"> it is the form that changes while the matter remains the same.</span> Change occurs when the arrangement of the matter changes, when it moves from one form to another.</p>
		<p>
			<u>Explanation of permanence</u>: Yet, even though the form of an object can change, it is form, <u>not matter</u>, that provides the order and permanence in the world. The matter of all things is ultimately the same; it could not account for the order and intelligibility that the changes of things have. There must be some part of the form of a thing, its <u>essential form</u>, that remains the same as the thing changes. The essential form of a thing determines what an object is and guides the changes and development of that thing. That is why we find changes intelligible or orderly. While some aspects of the form of a thing are always changing, as long as a thing remains in existence, its essential form must remain the same. For example, as a tree develops from a seed into a giant oak tree its form is constantly changing. Yet its changes are not random; it does not change into a rock or a pig. It changes in just the ways necessary to make it an oak tree. This is because some part of the tree stays the same from the time it is a seed until it is a mature oak. The essential form of a thing makes it what it is and guides the thing through its changes to its final goal. This is how there can be permanent objects in a world that is always changing.</p>
		<p>
			<u>C. The four causes: </u></p>
		<p>
			In order to understand how a thing comes about there are four things that it is necessary to know: (1) What type of material it is made of. (2) What type of thing it is. (3) What caused it to come into being; and (4) What purpose or function the thing is meant to fulfill. Take, for example, a table. To understand the table fully you need to know: (1) its material, that it is made of wood; (2) the arrangement of that material, the type of table it is or its shape (this is the form of the table); (3) how it was built, the various thing that had to be done to manufacture the table; and (4) the function of the table, that it is meant to be a dinner table or a desk. The first of these is the material cause. The second is the formal cause. The third is the efficient cause. The fourth is the final cause.</p>
		<p>
			It was the fourth of these causes that was Aristotle&#39;s most original contribution and which played the greatest role in both his theory of nature and his theory of form.</p>
		<p>
			<u>D. The theory of nature: </u></p>
		<p>
			Aristotle applied his doctrine of the four causes to the study of the natural world. Although all natural objects were composed of a certain matter and certain immediate causes for all their changes, it was the formal and final causes that drew most of Aristotle&#39;s attention. All objects, both alive and inanimate, have an essential form that makes them what they are and a goal or final state that they are progressing towards. These two causes were very closely related in Aristotle&#39;s natural science. Consider, for example, an acorn. It has a particular form, particular way that its matter is arranged. This is what makes it the type of thing it is, in this case the seed of an oak tree. This form defines for the acorn a goal or final state which defines it and guides all the various changes the acorn will go through. In this case the goal or final state is to be an oak tree. The goal or final cause guides the object through the various changes of form that the object goes through on the way to the accomplishment of its goal. It provides coherence, order, and intelligibility to the change that an object undergoes. The essential form of the thing, however, determines what goal it pursues. The final state of a thing depends upon what type of thing it is. This close connection of the final and formal causes led Aristotle to combine the two in his later account of what form is.</p>
		<p>
			One of the most important applications that Aristotle made of this theory was to the explanation of the motions of physical objects. Aristotle held that there were only four main types of things or elements. These were earth, air, fire, and water. Each of these had a natural place, which it strived to move towards. Earth strived to move towards the center of the planet Earth. Water&#39;s natural place was on the surface of the planet Earth. Air&#39;s natural place was next furthest from the earth, followed by fire. Finally, outside of the realm of the planet Earth, were the spheres of the stars. This was the place of a fifth, different element, aether. It was what made up the stars. The natural motions of objects and their weight depended, then, upon what type of object they were, for this determined their natural place or goal. Dirt for example moved down towards the natural place of Earth and was heavier than cotton, because it was composed mostly of earth instead of air and water. Everything moves the way it does because of the type of thing it is, because of its form. It was this that determined the natural place of the thing.</p>
		<p>
			<u>E. God in Aristotle&#39;s theory of nature and theory of form: </u></p>
		<p>
			God, for Aristotle, plays the role of both the eternal cause of all motion and the ultimate final cause of all motion and change. Motion is eternal for Aristotle; it is impossible that there could be a first motion, for this would require another motion to get it started. Nothing moves without a cause for Aristotle. The cause of this eternal motion cannot be simply another motion in the chain, it must itself be eternal and it must be unmoved itself. If it were not eternal it could not explain eternal motion. If it were moved itself, this motion itself would require another explanation. The eternal motion of nature requires an eternal unmoved mover or cause. This unmoved eternal mover is God for Aristotle.</p>
		<p>
			God is also the ultimate final cause of all things. All things tend towards God as their final state or goal, as a lover moves toward his beloved. It is the desire for this ultimate goal or fulfillment that fuels each object&#39;s development towards its own particular goal. God is seen as perfect activity or pure form; it is thought thinking itself.</p>
		<p>
			<u>F. Aristotle&#39;s theory of the soul: </u></p>
		<p>
			For Aristotle, the soul is the form of a living creature. It is the arrangement of the matter of its body so as to allow it to carry on all of the peculiar functions of living organisms. He identifies five such distinctive powers of the soul, all of which are not found in all organisms: (1) The nutritive: This is the power living beings have to grow and take in nourishment. (2) The appetitive: This is the power of desiring. (3) The sensory: This is the power of perceiving things with the senses. (4) The locomotive: This is the ability to move. (5) The reasoning.</p>
		<p>
			These are the different functions which the souls of different organisms fulfill. They are not parts of the soul, but different powers which organisms organized by a soul or form of the right type can exercise.</p>
		<p>
			<u>G. Human nature and happiness</u>:</p>
		<p>
			The essential form of human beings is their reason. Humans are rational animals. This determines what our final goal or purpose is. Reason is the ability to separate form from matter in abstract thought. For example, when I think of a table, I have the form of the table in my mind, but not the wood or matter. Thus, reason is the one way we can separate form from matter. Our final goal, then, is to separate our form from our matter and become like God, pure form or thought. We do this by developing our reason through the speculative life.</p>

		<p>
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">Introduction</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New">Plato expounded his Theory of Forms over a writing career of some forty years. The theory was being refined over this period and is never fully explained in any one dialogue. Thus, any explanation of the theory, involves piecing together fragments as they appear throughout Plato&#39;s writings, and recasting the earlier statements in the light of the metaphysical framework developed in the later works.</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">General Statement of the Theory of Forms</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New">The theory basically postulates the <span style="background-color:#ffff00;">existence of a level of reality or &quot;world&quot; inhabited by the ideal or archetypal forms of all things and concepts.</span> Thus a form exists, for objects like tables and rocks and for concepts, such as beauty and justice. In the dialogue Meno, Plato describes a form as the &quot;common nature&quot; possessed by a group of things or concepts. Speaking of virtue he says: </font></p>
		<dir>
		</dir>
		<dir>
		</dir>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New">And so of the virtues, however many and different they may be, they have all a common nature which makes them virtues; and on this he who would answer the question, &quot;What is virtue?&quot; would do well to have his eye fixed.</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2"><span style="background-color:#ffff00;">The forms are eternal and changeless</span>, but enter into a partnership with changeable matter, to produce the objects and examples of concepts, we perceive in the temporal world. These are always in a state of becoming, and may participate in a succession of forms. The ever changing temporal world can thus, only be the source of opinion. Plato likens the opinions derived from our senses, to the perception of shadows of real objects, cast upon the wall of a cave. True knowledge however, is the perception of the archetypal forms themselves, which are real, eternal, and unchanging. </font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">Whilst the forms are invisible to the eye, our souls have participated in the eternal world of forms prior to being incarnate in a physical body, and retain a memory of them. Although this memory is not readily accessible to the conscious mind, its presence is sufficient, to enable our limited perceptions. Plato maintains however, that the philosopher can achieve a state of perceiving the forms directly, with his mind&#39;s eye, by: developing skill, in discerning the abstract qualities, common to groups of things and ideas, in the temporal world; by realizing these are merely hypotheses; and by employing the method of dialectic, to categorize and group the qualities in their correct relationships and order; using these hypotheses as stepping stones, to further hypotheses. Thus reason is able to construct a hierarchy of forms, to scale to the height of first principle and attain a state of true knowledge.</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">All learning Plato maintains, is but recollection, of what our soul already knows. In the dialogue Meno, Plato agrees that enquiry is impossible, because, unless we already knew something, we would not recognize, the subject about which we were inquiring. But adds, that enquiry is worthwhile, in that it can uncover our innate memory.</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">An Assessment of the Strengths and Weaknesses of the Theory</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">In assessing the Theory of Forms it is important to remember that Plato was a profound language theorist. In the dialogue Cratylus he states that the Gods call things by their correct names, but the names given by men are not always correct. As there is meant to be a form corresponding to every name, or concept used by man, the notion of correct, or incorrect names, becomes extremely relevant. He notes that an important aspect of the dialectician&#39;s art is the giving of names. Although, as he notes in The Republic, the names or categories derived by dialectic are merely hypotheses, which the reason can use as &quot;steps and points of departure&quot; into a world which is above hypotheses. Thus the use of words in the dialogues can be easily misinterpreted. </font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">The great logical strength of the Theory of Forms is that it is a construction capable of adapting to all criticism: whilst there are archetypal forms that correspond to all terms used by man, many of the terms used by man are incorrect; only the Gods use correct names consistently. Whilst Socrates may be presented as agreeing with his interlocutors, this is usually a step in demonstrating their state of ignorance, and indeed that of Socrates. For in the true Socratic tradition the recognition of one&#39;s own ignorance, is seen as an advancement of knowledge. What is more, if a discussion results in confusion and seeming contradiction, then that too can be seen as the theory at work, for Plato develops in Philebus and Phaedo the notion that because the world of the senses, the &quot;seen&quot; world, is compounded and finite, the one archetypal form (the &quot;unseen&quot;) gives rise to apparent opposites on that level. </font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">It is important to realise that the Theory of Forms is an hypothesis that is proven by the process of inference to the best explanation. It is a grand image that identifies levels of reality, and metaphysical functionalities that Plato reasoned must exist, to make any sense of the world. The actual mechanical processes involved are only defined in a very abstract manner, but even here, the theory has a counter, in that man cannot presume to conceive of the physiology of the Gods. </font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">Because the Theory of Forms is an inference to the best explanation, its true strength or soundness must be gauged by its continued use over time. The abstract nature of its definition makes it compatible with many systems of thought: some derived from Plato, others developed independently; some arising after Plato&#39;s time, others predating him. If we ask the question of why in the two thousand years of suppression of ideas and burning of books that has been the Christian era, Plato&#39;s dialogues have survived intact, we must answer that Plato&#39;s theories are fundamentally supportive of basic Christian doctrine. </font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">Whilst the details of the mechanics are scanty, Plato&#39;s notion that the power to abstract and perceive the commonalties in apparent opposites is our &quot;step and point of departure&quot; to true knowledge, is a theme we can discern in all the great systems of human thought. </font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">Finally, the notion of &quot;the reason&quot; is crucial in understanding Plato. Plato makes it clear that the reason is a higher, vaster faculty than intellect. The Theory of Forms is itself an hypothesis. The intellect and logic may follow after the image and devise explanations, but the hypothesis is firstly a creation of the imagination, &quot;the logician can provide no rules for the formulation of an hypothesis&quot;.</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">Thus the great strengths of the Theory of Forms are the notions of levels of reality and human faculties, it identifies as existing, or needing to exist if life is to be intelligible. Its weaknesses spring from, and illustrate the inadequacies of human words and concepts to approach a description of the infinite or timeless. The theory still stands as a beacon after two and a half thousand years, attesting to the vast sweep of mind Plato was able to attain, using the simple means he found in himself and the strength he found by the acknowledgement of his own weakness. </font></p>

			<font face="Courier New" size="2">From the SOPHIST</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2"><i>Str</i>. Should we not say that the division according to classes, which neither makes the same other, nor makes other the same, is the business of the dialectical science?</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2"><i>Theaet</i>. That is what we should say. </font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2"><i>Str</i>. Then, surely, he who can divide rightly is able to see clearly one form pervading a scattered multitude, and many different forms contained under one higher form; and again, one form knit together into a single whole and pervading many such wholes, and many forms, existing only in separation and isolation. This is the knowledge of classes, which determines where they can have communion with one another and where not. </font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">From the MENO</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2"><i>Soc</i>. How fortunate I am, Meno! When I ask you for one virtue, you present me with a swarm of</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">them, which are in your keeping. Suppose that I carry on the figure of the swarm, and ask of you,</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">What is the nature of the bee? and you answer that there are many kinds of bees, and I reply: But do bees differ as bees, because there are many and different kinds of them; or are they not rather to be distinguished by some other quality, as for example beauty, size, or shape? How would you answer me? </font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2"><i>Meno</i>. I should answer that bees do not differ from one another, as bees. </font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2"><i>Soc</i>. And if I went on to say: That is what I desire to know, Meno; tell me what is the quality in which they do not differ, but are all alike; would you be able to answer? </font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2"><i>Meno</i>. I should. </font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2"><i>Soc</i>. And so of the virtues, however many and different they may be, they have all a common nature which makes them virtues; and on this he who would answer the question, &quot;What is virtue?&quot; would do well to have his eye fixed: Do you understand? </font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2"><i>Meno</i>. I am beginning to understand; but I do not as yet take hold of the question as I could wish. </font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2"><i>Soc</i>. To what then do we give the name of figure? Try and answer. Suppose that when a person asked you this question either about figure or color, you were to reply, &quot;I do not understand what you want, or know what you are saying,&quot; he would look rather astonished and say, &quot;Do you not understand that I am looking for the [likeness among many]?&quot; And then he might put the question in another form: &quot;Meno,&quot; he might say, &quot;what is that [likeness among many] which you call figure, and which includes not only round and straight figures, but all?&quot; Could you not answer that question, Meno? I wish that you would try; the attempt will be good practice with a view to the answer about virtue. </font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">From the PHILEBUS</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2"><i>Pro</i>. Why, Socrates, they are opposed in so far as they spring from opposite sources, but they are</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New">not in themselves opposite. For must not pleasure be of all things most absolutely like pleasure &ndash; that is, like himself?</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2"><i>Soc</i>. Yes, my good friend, just as color is like color; &ndash; in so far as colors are colors, there is no difference between them; and yet we all know that black is not only unlike, but even absolutely opposed to white: or again, as figure is like figure, for all figures are comprehended under one class; and yet particular figures may be absolutely opposed to one another, and there is an infinite diversity of them. And we might find similar examples in many other things; therefore do not rely upon this argument, which would go to prove the unity of the most extreme opposites.</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">From the REPUBLIC</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;Then I will try again; you will understand me better when I have made some preliminary remarks. You are aware that students of geometry, arithmetic, and the kindred sciences assume the odd and the even and the figures and three kinds of angles and the like in their several branches of science; these are their hypotheses, which they and everybody are supposed to know, and therefore they do not deign to give any account of them either to themselves or others; but they begin with them, and go on until they arrive at last, and in a consistent manner, at their conclusion?&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;Yes,&quot; he said, &quot;I know.&quot; </font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;And do you not know also that although they make use of the visible forms and reason about them, they are thinking not of these, but of the ideals which they resemble; not of the figures which they draw, but of the absolute square and the absolute diameter, and so on &ndash; the forms which they draw or make, and which have shadows and reflections in water of their own, are converted by them into images, but they are really seeking to behold the things themselves, which can only be seen with the eye of the mind?&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">From the PHAEDO</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;And the uncompounded may be assumed to be the same and unchanging, where the compound is always changing and never the same? That I also think, he said. Then now let us return to the previous discussion. Is that idea or essence, which in the dialectical process we define as essence of true existence &ndash; whether essence of equality, beauty, or anything else: are these essences, I say, liable at times to some degree of change? or are they each of them always what they are, having the same simple, self-existent and unchanging forms, and not admitting of variation at all, or in any way, or at any time?&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;They must be always the same, Socrates,&quot; replied Cebes. </font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;And what would you say of the many beautiful &ndash; whether men or horses or garments or any other things which may be called equal or beautiful &ndash; are they all unchanging and the same always, or quite the reverse? May they not rather be described as almost always changing and hardly ever the same either with themselves or with one another?&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;The latter,&quot; replied Cebes, &quot;they are always in a state of change.&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;And these you can touch and see and perceive with the senses, but the unchanging things you can only perceive with the mind &ndash; they are invisible and are not seen?&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;That is very true,&quot; Cebes replied. </font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;Well, then,&quot; he added, &quot;let us suppose that there are two sorts of existences, one seen, the other unseen. Let us suppose them. The seen is the changing, and the unseen is the unchanging.&quot; </font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;That may be also supposed,&quot; Cebes said.</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">From the PARMENIDES</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;Yes, Socrates,&quot; said Parmenides, &quot;that is because you are still young; the time will come, if I am not mistaken, when philosophy will have a firmer grasp of you, and then you will not despise even the meanest things; at your age, you are too much disposed to regard opinions of men. But I should like to know whether you mean that there are certain ideas of which all other things partake, and from which they derive their names; that similar things, for example, become similar because they partake of similarity; and great things become great, because they partake of greatness; and that just and beautiful things become just and beautiful, because they partake of justice and beauty?&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;Yes, certainly,&quot; said Socrates &quot;that is my meaning.&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;Then each individual partakes either of the whole of the idea or else of a part of the idea? Can there be any other mode of participation?&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;There cannot be,&quot; he said. </font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;Then do you think that the whole idea is one, and yet, being one, is in each one of the many?&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;Why not, Parmenides?&quot; said Socrates. </font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;Because one and the same thing will exist as a whole at the same time in many separate individuals, and will therefore be in a state of separation from itself. Nay, but the idea may be like the day which is one and the same in many places at once, and yet continuous with itself; in this way each idea may be one; and the same in all at the same time.&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;I like your way, Socrates, of making one in many places at once. You mean to say, that if I were to spread out a sail and cover a number of men, there would be one whole including many &ndash; is not that your meaning?&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;I think so.&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;And would you say that the whole sail includes each man, or a part of it only, and different parts different men?&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;The latter.&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;Then, Socrates, the ideas themselves will be divisible, and things which participate in them will have a part of them only and not the whole idea existing in each of them?&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;That seems to follow.&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;Then would you like to say, Socrates, that the one idea is really divisible and yet remains one?&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;Certainly not,&quot; he said. </font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;Suppose that you divide absolute greatness, and that of the many great things, each one is great in virtue of a portion of greatness less than absolute greatness &ndash; is that conceivable?&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;No.&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;Or will each equal thing, if possessing some small portion of equality less than absolute equality, be equal to some other thing by virtue of that portion only?&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;Impossible.&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;Or suppose one of us to have a portion of smallness; this is but a part of the small, and therefore the absolutely small is greater; if the absolutely small be greater, that to which the part of the small is added will be smaller and not greater than before.&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;How absurd!&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;Then in what way, Socrates, will all things participate in the ideas, if they are unable to participate in them either as parts or wholes?&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;Indeed,&quot; he said, &quot;you have asked a question which is not easily answered.&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;Well,&quot; said Parmenides, &quot;and what do you say of another question?&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;What question?&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;I imagine that the way in which you are led to assume one idea of each kind is as follows: You see a number of great objects, and when you look at them there seems to you to be one and the same idea, or nature, in them all. Hence you conceive of greatness as one.&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;Very true,&quot; said Socrates.</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;And if you go on and allow your mind in like manner to embrace in one view the idea of greatness and of great things which are not the idea, and to compare them, will not another greatness arise, which will appear to be the source of all these?&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;It would seem so.&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;Then another idea of greatness now comes into view over and above absolute greatness, and the individuals which partake of it; and then another, over and above all these, by virtue of which they will all be great, and so each idea instead of being one will be infinitely multiplied.&quot; </font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;But may not the ideas,&quot; asked Socrates, &quot;be thoughts only, and have no proper existence except in our minds, Parmenides? For in that case each idea may still be one, and not experience this infinite multiplication.&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;And can there be individual thoughts which are thoughts of nothing?&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;Impossible,&quot; he said. </font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;The thought must be of something?&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;Yes.&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;Of something which is or which is not?&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;Of something which is.&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;Must it not be of a single something, which the thought recognizes as attaching to all, being a single form or nature?&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;Yes.&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;And will not the something which is apprehended as one and the same in all, be an idea?&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;From that, again, there is no escape.&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;Then,&quot; said Parmenides, &quot;if you say that everything else participates in the ideas, must you not say either that everything is made up of thoughts, and that all things think; or that they are thoughts but have no thought?&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;The latter view, Parmenides, is no more rational than the previous one. In my opinion, the ideas are, as it were, patterns fixed in nature, and other things are like them, and resemblances of them &ndash; what is meant by the participation of other things in the ideas, is really assimilation to them.&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;But if, said he, the individual is like the idea, must not the idea also be like the individual, in so far as the individual is a resemblance of the idea? That which is like, cannot be conceived of as other than the like of like.&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;Impossible.&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;And when two things are alike, must they not partake of the same idea?&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;They must.&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;And will not that of which the two partake, and which makes them alike, be the idea itself?&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;Certainly.&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;Then the idea cannot be like the individual, or the individual like the idea; for if they are alike, some further idea of likeness will always be coming to light, and if that be like anything else, another; and new ideas will be always arising, if the idea resembles that which partakes of it?&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;Quite true.&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;The theory, then that other things participate in the ideas by resemblance, has to be given up, and some other mode of participation devised?&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
			<font face="Courier New" size="2">&quot;It would seem so.&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="JUSTIFY">
